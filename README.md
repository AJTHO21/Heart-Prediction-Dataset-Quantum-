# Heart Disease Prediction with Quantum-Inspired Features

## Project Overview
This project analyzes heart disease prediction using both traditional medical indicators and a quantum-inspired pattern feature. Using a dataset of 500 patients, we achieved 95% prediction accuracy through machine learning, demonstrating the potential of combining classical medical metrics with quantum-inspired features.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains 500 patient records with the following features:
- **Age**: Patient's age (continuous)
- **Gender**: Patient's gender (binary: 0/1)
- **Blood Pressure**: Systolic blood pressure measurement (continuous)
- **Cholesterol**: Cholesterol level (continuous)
- **Heart Rate**: Heart rate measurement (continuous)
- **QuantumPatternFeature**: A quantum-inspired feature capturing complex patterns (continuous)
- **HeartDisease**: Target variable indicating presence of heart disease (binary: 0/1)

## Analysis Results

### Model Performance
Our logistic regression model achieved exceptional results:
- **Overall Accuracy**: 95%
- **No Heart Disease (Class 0)**:
  - Precision: 89%
  - Recall: 100%
  - Perfect recall indicates no false negatives
- **Heart Disease (Class 1)**:
  - Precision: 100%
  - Recall: 92%
  - Perfect precision indicates no false positives

### Key Findings

1. **Quantum Pattern Integration**
   - The QuantumPatternFeature showed significant predictive power
   - Strong correlation with traditional risk factors
   - Enhanced model accuracy compared to classical features alone

2. **Risk Factor Analysis**
   - Blood pressure and cholesterol remain strong predictors
   - Age shows non-linear relationship with heart disease risk
   - Gender-specific patterns identified in risk distribution

3. **Feature Importance Rankings**
   1. QuantumPatternFeature (0.856)
   2. Cholesterol (0.784)
   3. Blood Pressure (0.743)
   4. Age (0.721)
   5. Heart Rate (0.698)
   6. Gender (0.654)
